        	<p><b>This is my Digital Photography project for my AENG110 class. As you can see here I took some photos of things around the campus, dorm room, and the park my hometown Malvern.<br><br>This project required me to use both Adobe Photoshop and Indesign for the photos I took, I used photoshop to use the clone stamp tool to cover up certian things in the photos we took like scratches and glares. It was kind of a tricky tool for me to use for the first time until I got the hang of it. <br><br> After the clone stamp tools were finished, I used lighting tools to adjust the lighting and contrast in the image so certian objects could be viewed more easily.<br><br>After the edits were done, I made an Idesign file where took the original and the editied images side by side and explained everything I did with each specific photograph.</b></p>
