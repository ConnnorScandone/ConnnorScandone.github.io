        	<p><b>This is my Infographic project for my AENG110 class. As you can see here I made a poster about the history of the computer mouse and how it has evolved over the years, from the first model in 1964 to the most recent model in the modern days.<br><br>This project required me to use both Adobe Photoshop and Indesign for this project, I used photoshop so my images had a transparent backgroung and proper resolution for when I was making the images for the final draft that was going to be created with Adobe Indesign. <br><br> After the images were finished, I made my indesign file and inserted my image files for the project.<br><br>I did some internet research on each computer mouse model and what years each model was around for, when I got everything I needed for the research, I evenly spaced everything out so it wasn't overlapping on top of the text boxes and images.</b></p>
